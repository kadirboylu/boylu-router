# Introduction

`@boylu/router` is a simple and lightweight client-side router for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows you to define routes and render components based on the current URL, making it easy to build dynamic, responsive UIs that respond to user interactions.

## Features

- Simple API for defining routes and rendering components
- Supports nested routes and dynamic URL parameters
- Handles browser navigation events for seamless user experience

## Motivation

Many contemporary web applications are designed as single-page applications (SPAs), in which a solitary HTML page serves as the application shell, while content is dynamically loaded and updated via JavaScript. In SPAs, client-side routing is a crucial feature, as it enables the application to respond to changes in the URL without having to reload the page.

For the purposes of learning and comprehending how client-side routing works, I endeavored to create a basic router. My intention was to develop a router that was lightweight, featuring a straightforward API that was easy to understand and utilize. I subsequently released the router as an open-source package, so that others could incorporate it into their own projects.

In order to enhance usability, I have utilized terminology that is akin to that present in [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). This approach enables developers who possess prior familiarity with Vue Router to gain a better grasp of the subject matter.
