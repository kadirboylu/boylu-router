# Boylu Router

Boylu Router is a simple SPA router for JavaScript. It is a very small library, and it is easy to use. I created this project for learning purposes and then decided to publish it as an open-source package. I use similiar terminology to [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) to make it easier for developers who are familiar with Vue Router to understand the subject matter.

See the [documentation](https://boylu-router-docs.vercel.app/) for more information.
